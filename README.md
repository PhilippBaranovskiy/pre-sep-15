task: airport

	located in airport.html ( http://rockfield.github.io/pre-sep-15/airport.html )

It has been done without:

	- stiky table header
	- normal centered popup

Out of not having server template engine I replaced it with js template to reduce handle changes while marking up.

How to run: you need nodeJS, npm and bower.

	> npm install && bower install
