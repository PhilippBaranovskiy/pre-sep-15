task: airport

	located in airport.html

It has been done without:

	- stiky table header
	- normal centered popup

Out of not having server template engine I replaced it with js template to reduce handle changes while marking up.

How to run: you need nodeJS, npm and bower.

	> npm install && bower install

task: web audio player

	located in webaudio.html

It's unfinished due my busy, but I realized how it should be work.
Actually I chose incorrect way and it should be work via AudioContext instead of simple html5 audio system. But I've lost my time to do it already.
